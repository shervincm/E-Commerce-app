# E-Commerce-app

Hello and welcome to my E-Commerce app. This app is a simple e-commerce app that allows users to filter through items via search, and 2 filter options and allows them to add as many items to their cart. The app is built with React, React-Router and a RESTful API. The app also uses MongoDB for the database, and Express for the server. The app is deployed on Netlify for the front end and Render for the back end.
